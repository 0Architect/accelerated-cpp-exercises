The key is to realize that every addition to the vector, shifts the median by 1 to either to the left (greater than the current median) or to the right(smaller than the current median) of the vector. Or remains the same (equal to the median).
Using the aforementioned idea, given a vector v, you can move the median to any value contained in this original vector, by adding values (either greater or less than the median) to the vector.
So regardless of wherever the discarded value is located, by adding values either smaller or greater than the median, you can systematically move the median to where the discarded value is.
