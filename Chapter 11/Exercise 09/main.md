The efficiency gains of this strategy can be estimated based on the average number of reallocations required when inserting elements into the vector. With exponential growth, the number of reallocations is proportional to the logarithm of the number of elements. In other words, if the size of the vector is n, the number of reallocations is approximately log2(n).

To measure the actual difference in efficiency, you can modify the grow function to allocate a fixed amount of additional memory each time instead of doubling it. For example, instead of doubling the capacity, you can increase it by a fixed factor (e.g., 1.5 times).
