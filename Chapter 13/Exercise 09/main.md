If the assignment operator in the Core class fails to check for self-assignment, it can lead to several issues and unexpected behavior specific to the Core class and any classes derived from it. Let's explore the potential consequences:

Inconsistent State: When the assignment operator is invoked without self-assignment checks, the object's data members, such as midterm, final, and homework, might be overwritten with their own values. This results in an inconsistent state where the object's data is modified unnecessarily, potentially leading to incorrect calculations or unexpected behavior.

Resource Leakage: If the Core class or its derived classes manage dynamically allocated resources, such as memory or file handles, failing to check for self-assignment can cause resource leakage. Without proper checks, the assignment operator might overwrite the existing resource pointers without releasing them, leading to memory leaks or other resource-related issues.

Incorrect Results: Self-assignment can introduce errors in calculations and grade calculations. If the assignment operator modifies the object's data members without considering self-assignment, subsequent operations or function calls that rely on these members may produce incorrect results.

Unintended Side Effects: Failing to check for self-assignment can result in unintended side effects when other member functions or operations are performed after self-assignment. These side effects can manifest as unexpected behavior, incorrect computations, or data corruption.
